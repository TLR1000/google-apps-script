Scripts for Google Apps

This repo is where I'll keep some scripts and a number of them are used for the construction of twitter troll messages regarding controversial subjects. Make waves! The main purpose of them is to understand how things work, and that is the reason for their existence.

How to Use Google Scripts

Visit the Google Scripts site (http://script.google.com/)and create your first script. 
Scripts are stored in Google Drive, so you can edit them there later on.
Then just paste this script into a new Script document.
